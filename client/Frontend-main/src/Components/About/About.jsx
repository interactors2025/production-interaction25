            <p>
            Over the last 22 years, the Computer Science Department at Modern College Ganeshkhind
            has been the driving force behind "Interaction," an intercollegiate event fostering a 
            dynamic platform for student engagement. Year after year, this event has celebrated the
            spirit of innovation, competition, and camaraderie among students passionate about technology and
            creativity.

            <p>
            With a legacy spanning over two decades, Interaction has showcased a diverse range of 
            competitions, including blind coding challenges, poster presentations, gaming tournaments, 
            and more. Each year, our dedicated team organizes and hosts this extravaganza, shaping it into
             an event students eagerly anticipate.

            Interaction is not just about winning; it's about fostering a community where participants 
            can network, learn, and grow. A scrumptious breakfast fuels the participants, while the games
